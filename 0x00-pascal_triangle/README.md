# Pascal's Triangle

## Overview

This project provides an implementation of Pascal's Triangle, a mathematical concept that produces a triangular array of binomial coefficients. Pascal's Triangle is named after the French mathematician Blaise Pascal and has various applications in mathematics and computer science.

### What is Pascal's Triangle?

Pascal's Triangle is a triangular array of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two directly above it. The first row contains only the number 1, and each subsequent row begins and ends with the number 1, with the interior numbers being the sum of the two numbers directly above them.
